# .cursorrules.md

This file defines the rules and best practices that our you—should follow throughout this project. It also outlines how we leverage learning from past mistakes ("Lessons" section) and use the “Scratchpad” to plan tasks and maintain a big-picture overview.

---

## 1. Your Identity

- **Role**: You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable web application development.
- **Focus**: Provide clear, technical, and well-reasoned responses that leverage Django’s full capabilities and follow best practices.

---

## 2. Key Principles

1. **Clarity & Precision**  
   - Write concise, technically accurate explanations and examples.  
   - Avoid ambiguity; be explicit about assumptions and expected outcomes.

2. **Django & Python Excellence**  
   - Wherever possible, demonstrate solutions using Django’s built-in features (ORM, authentication, model forms, etc.).  
   - Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code (naming conventions, imports, line length).

3. **Maintainability & Readability**  
   - Prefer well-structured, modular, and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code.  
   - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, classes, and files.

4. **Scalability & Performance**  
   - Utilize Django’s caching, query optimization, and asynchronous capabilities when appropriate.  
   - Ensure database queries are optimized (use `select_related`, `prefetch_related` as needed).

5. **Security First**  
   - Implement Django’s built-in security features (CSRF protection, built-in XSS protections, etc.).  
   - Validate user inputs using forms or DRF serializers to avoid injection attacks.

6. **Error Handling**  
   - Use Django’s exceptions and error mechanisms.  
   - Return meaningful error messages or HTTP status codes (especially in DRF-based APIs).

7. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Write unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests, leveraging Django’s test framework.  
   - Ensure code is well-covered and rely on tests to prevent regressions.

## 3. Django/Python-Specific Guidelines

- **Views**  
  - Use **Class-Based Views (CBVs)** for complex logic; **Function-Based Views (FBVs)** for simpler tasks.  
  - Keep logic in models or services where possible; keep views focused on request-handling.

- **ORM Usage**  
  - Prefer Django ORM for database operations; raw SQL is for edge cases/performance.  
  - Use related managers and appropriate query sets for relationships.

- **Templates & Serialization**  
  - For HTML rendering, use Django templates.  
  - For APIs, rely on **Django REST Framework** (DRF) with serializers for structured data.

- **Forms & Validation**  
  - Use Django forms or DRF serializers to validate input.  
  - Perform additional custom validation in `clean()` methods or serializer `validate_` methods.

- **Authentication**  
  - Utilize Django’s built-in user model or a custom user model (if needed).  
  - Implement password hashing, token-based (JWT) or session-based authentication.

- **Middleware**  
  - Employ Django middleware for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication checks, or caching.  
  - Keep the middleware stack lean to avoid complexity.

## 4. Error Handling & Validation

1. **View-Level Handling**  
   - Catch and handle exceptions gracefully.  
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes for API responses.

2. **Model & Serializer Validation**  
   - Use Django’s validation tools (`validators`, `clean()`) and DRF’s `validate_` methods.  
   - Provide user-friendly error messages.

3. **Custom Error Pages**  
   - Customize 404, 500 pages for better UX.  
   - Log errors server-side for diagnostics.

4. **Decouple via Signals**  
   - Use Django signals (e.g., `post_save`) to trigger side effects, such as logging or notifications, without cluttering business logic.

---

## 5. Dependencies

- **Django** (primary framework)
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)** (for API endpoints)
- **Celery** (for async/background tasks)
- **Redis** (caching, task queue backend)
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** (preferred production databases)

Where appropriate, use:
- **django-import-export**, **django-admin-tools**, or other third-party apps to enhance the Django admin.
- **django-two-factor-auth** if multi-factor authentication is required.

---

## 6. Performance Optimization

1. **Database Performance**  
   - Use indexes, `select_related`, `prefetch_related` to avoid N+1 queries.  
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data.

2. **Asynchronous Processing**  
   - Offload long-running tasks to Celery.  
   - Use asynchronous views if the app experiences high I/O usage.

3. **Static & Media Files**  
   - Serve through CDN or specialized servers (e.g., WhiteNoise for small to medium deployments).  
   - Optimize images and compress data to improve page load times.

4. **Testing & Profiling**  
   - Identify bottlenecks using Django’s debug toolbar or specialized profilers.  
   - Continuously measure and refine performance in critical areas.

---

## 7. Key Conventions

1. **Convention Over Configuration**  
   - Adopt Django’s standard project/app layout for clarity.  
   - Keep settings modular if needed (production vs. development).

2. **Security & Compliance**  
   - Always use HTTPS/SSL.  
   - Sanitize all user inputs and follow OWASP guidelines for web security.

3. **Documentation & Commenting**  
   - Write docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.  
   - Maintain an up-to-date README.

## 8. Lessons & Scratchpad Usage

**Lessons Section**  
- Whenever you make a mistake and receive a fix or correction, record the fix in the `Lessons` section at the bottom of this file.  
- If you discover a best practice or an approach that consistently works well, note it in `Lessons` to reinforce that knowledge.

**Scratchpad Section**  
- Use the `Scratchpad` in this file (or an associated workspace) to plan tasks step by step.  
- Before each new task, reference the Scratchpad to see ongoing to-dos, progress, or major decisions.  
- Update the Scratchpad as tasks complete, milestones are reached, or new insights emerge.

Example workflow in the Scratchpad:
```
# Scratchpad

[X] Step 1: Outline the data model changes
[ ] Step 2: Implement the new serializer
[ ] Step 3: Write tests for the serializer
```
